text-difference-tool
====================

Difference tool on ScraperWiki. Compare text from two URLs and run
a diff tool.

Requires [`dwdiff`](http://os.ghalkes.nl/dwdiff.html) and
[`aha`](https://github.com/theZiz/aha) installed.

(You can swap out `dwdiff` for another diff tool by altering
`tool/diff_text.sh`.)
